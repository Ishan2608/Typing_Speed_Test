# Typing Speed Tester: Python Tkinter Desktop Application

Welcome to the Typing Speed Tester repository, a GUI desktop application project developed using Python and its Tkinter library. This project aims to enhance your typing skills by providing a user-friendly interface to practice typing various sentences. With each sentence, you'll be able to see your typing speed and accuracy, empowering you to improve your typing proficiency. The application also calculates your average typing speed across all the sentences, giving you valuable insights into your progress. Remember that time is of the essence in this challenge, as pausing for more than 5 seconds results in a loss. Sharpen your typing skills and put them to the test with the Typing Speed Tester desktop application.
